'''Now, in every machine learning program, there are two things, features and labels. 
Features are the part of a dataset which are used to predict the label. 
And labels on the other hand are mapped to features. 

After the model has been trained, we give features to it, so that it can predict the labels.
So, if we analyse this dataset, since we have to predict the wine quality, 
the attribute quality will become our label and the rest of the attributes will become the 
features.
